# My-first-software-development-repository
This software repository contains my first software for the module Software Development. It stores all of the related files including a README file which contains information about the software I have written.
### This is the first Software development project and course for the MSc. Computer Science at the University of Law.
1. At the second session of the course, git and GitHub basics are discussed including the introduction about git and in particular commands required for working with distributed repositories like gitHub such as git init, commit, update, and so on. 
2. This session also covered the concepts of branching, cherry picking, rebasing and submodules on github which give an overview of the activities we may consider while working with github.
